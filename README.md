### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name is Nicolas.
### In my page you will mainly see videogames that i have made (or tried to) and some webpages
### I have some experience with the unity engine creating [4 little games](https://cranile.itch.io/) (from 2018 to 2019).
### From 2021 to 2022 i mainly worked as a front end developer with HTML, CSS, JS and React.
### during that time i made some personal pages on the side and i tried to make an tilebased roguelike using only HTML and JS
### *[A tilemap editor to create and export little "web cities"](https://tohaheavyindustries.gitlab.io/WebCities/)/[Code](https://gitlab.com/tohaheavyindustries/WebCities)/[Documentation](https://cranile.gitbook.io/web-cities/)
### *[Rogue JS](https://nicolascrapanzano.github.io/Simple-Rogue/)/[Code](https://github.com/NicolasCrapanzano/Simple-Rogue)
### *[Vetcenter landing page](https://nicolascrapanzano.github.io/vetcenterLanding/)/[Code](https://github.com/NicolasCrapanzano/vetcenterLanding)
### But making games without and engine is annoying (even 2D ones)
### So from 2022 to now(2023) i moved to the Godot engine.
### i have made 3 games so far ( you can try them here https://cranile.itch.io/ ;) ) and im currently working on a VR game.
### *[The epic quest for becoming a web dev](https://cranile.itch.io/the-epic-quest-for-becoming-a-web-dev)/[Code](https://github.com/NicolasCrapanzano/ludumdare51)
### *[A flower field](https://cranile.itch.io/a-flower-field)/[Code](https://github.com/NicolasCrapanzano/A-flower-field-32bitjam-)
### *[Parallel reality on dream land](https://cranile.itch.io/parallel-reality-on-dream-land)/[Code](https://github.com/NicolasCrapanzano/LSDJAM2022)
### I hope you like my code and thanks for cheking in! <3
