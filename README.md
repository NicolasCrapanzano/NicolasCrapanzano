### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My Name is Nicolas.
### In my page you will mainly see videogames that i have made (or tried to) and some webpages
### I have some experience with the unity engine (from 2018 to 2019)
### From 2021 to 2022 i mainly worked as a front end developer with HTML, CSS and JS
### during that time i made some personal pages on the side and i tried to make an tilebased roguelike using only HTML and JS
### But making games without and engine is annoying (even 2D ones)
### So from 2022 to now(2023) i moved to the Godot engine.
### i have made 3 games so far ( you can try them here https://cranile.itch.io/ ;) ) and im currently working on a VR game.
### I hope you like my code and thanks for cheking in! <3
